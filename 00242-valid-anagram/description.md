# [242. Valid Anagram](https://leetcode.com/problems/valid-anagram/description/)

Difficulty: Easy

Given two string `s` and `t`, return `true` *if `t` is an anagram of `s`, and `false` otherwise*.

An **anagram** is a word or phrase formed by rearranging the letters of a different word or phrase, typically using all the original letters exactly once.

## Examples

### Example 1

```text
Input: s = "anagram", t = "nagaram"
Output: true
```

### Example 2

```text
Input: s = "rat", t = "car"
Output: false
```

## Constraints

- $1 \leq s.length, t.length \leq 5 * 10^4$
- `s` and `t` consist of lowercase English letters

## Follow up

What if the inputs contain Unicode characters? How would you adopt your solution to such a case?
